With a mother's hands the work is never done,
As she fashions what she can of a daughter or a son.
As she she shapes and molds them into what they will become,
There is faith in a mother's hands.

Her hands of service and compassion
Tender warm hands build a home

In a mother's eyes lies the hope of all the world,
As she sings her lullaby to each baby boy and girl,
And the tears flow freely every time the flag unfurls.
There is hope in a mother's eyes.

Her eyes comfort and encourage
Through the dark skies see us home

In a mother's heart lies the secret to it all.
Tender feelings start for the children great and small.
Only she compares to the greatest one of all.
There is love in a mother's heart.

One love leads us to another
Mother's true love brings us home

I see mother kneel and gently fold her hands.
Eyes she closes still, for she seeks to understand.
Heavenly Father's will - her heart loves what He commands.
Thank the Lord for a mother's heart,
For a mother's eyes,
For my mother's hands.
