guitar-chords
=============

Tabs or Chords for songs on guitar that I'd rather not have to figure out from scratch again.

There's a chord chart I've been using that is really helpful to me. Thanks [Phillip J Facoline](mailto:pfacol@elaine.ee.und.ac.za)!

I don't know how you go about licensing attempted descriptions of other people's works, but feel free to copy my chords and post them to whatever tabs/chords sites you like. I'd appreciate attribution.
