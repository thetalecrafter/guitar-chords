(Intro)
C Cadd9 C F G Gsus G

     C                Cadd9        C
I've been to New York City Central Park
            F              G              Gsus G
then headed out to upstate Lake Champlain
        C             Cadd9                     C
crossed up to Montreal and heard a band playing mandolins
F              G                    Gsus G
 while we were standing in the rain
          C                Cadd9          C
I've seen castle walls and waterfalls and bridges spanning
F             G         Gsus G
over Venetian waterways
C               Cadd9                C
backpack summer drifting through the mountains
            F        G
filled with European hostel stays

                  Am   F     C             G
but all I need is you, here, falling in my arms
    Am  F      C               G
and me, there, subject to your charms
Am           F              C              G          F
 and I don't know if I have ever felt this way before
                  C Ca99 C F G Gsus G
all I need is you 

I've sailed out in the San Francisco bay 
And I've seen fireworks light up the night 
I've eaten dinner with good friends 
Authentic Mexican patio dining in the moonlight 
I've spent days skiing sunny powdered peaks 
And hiking up to Zions where the angels land 
I've Dropped off cliffs into the crystal blue 
And I've set up tents on golden sand 

but all I need is you, here, falling in my arms 
and me, there, subject to your charms 
and I don't know if I have ever felt this way before 
all I need is you 

     F
I've been all over the rocky mountains

Splashed in England's Hyde Park fountains
C                        G
Seen Denali rising up at three A.M.
            F
Watched the wind blow through the red wood forest

Heard the tabernacle chorus
C                                     G
singing songs like angels do in heaven

but all I need is you, here, falling in my arms 
and me, there, subject to your charms 
and I don't know if I have ever felt this way before 
all I need is you
